# World Structure Manipulation

This exercise demonstrates adding and removing entities from the kinematic structure.

You will:
- Create a simple world with a passive 6DoF connection and an active revolute joint
- Remove the revolute connection and its child body in a single modification block

## 0. Setup

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]
from semantic_digital_twin.world import World
from semantic_digital_twin.world_description.world_entity import Body
from semantic_digital_twin.world_description.connections import Connection6DoF, RevoluteConnection
from semantic_digital_twin.world_description.degree_of_freedom import DegreeOfFreedom
from semantic_digital_twin.datastructures.prefixed_name import PrefixedName
from semantic_digital_twin.spatial_types.spatial_types import Vector3
from krrood.entity_query_language.entity import entity, an, let, the
```

## 1. Create a simple kinematic structure
Your goal:
- Create a `World` and three bodies named `root`, `base`, and `body`
- Add a passive `Connection6DoF` between `root` (parent) and `base` (child)
- Add a `RevoluteConnection` between `base` (parent) and `body` (child) using a Z axis on `base`
- Store the world in a variable named `world` and the revolute connection in `base_C_body`
- Add the Connections to the world.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [exercise]
# TODO: create the world and connections described above
world: World = ...
root: Body = ...
base: Body = ...
body: Body = ...
root_C_base: Connection6DoF = ...
base_C_body_dof: DegreeOfFreedom = ...
base_C_body: RevoluteConnection = ...


```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [example-solution]
world = World()
root = Body(name=PrefixedName(name="root", prefix="world"))
base = Body(name=PrefixedName("base"))
body = Body(name=PrefixedName("body"))

with world.modify_world():
    root_C_base = Connection6DoF.create_with_dofs(parent=root, child=base, world=world)
    base_C_body = RevoluteConnection.create_with_dofs(
            parent=base,
            child=body,
            axis=Vector3.Z(reference_frame=base),
            world=world
        )
    world.add_connection(root_C_base)    
    world.add_connection(base_C_body)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [verify-solution, remove-input]

# Check that the world contains the expected entities
assert len(world.bodies) == 3, "The world should contain exactly three bodies."
assert len(world.connections) == 2, "The world should contain exactly two connections."
```
## 2. Remove a connection and its child
Your goal:
- In a single `with world.modify_world():` block, remove the revolute connection and the now disconnected child body `body`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [exercise]
# TODO: remove the revolute connection and its child body in one modification block, without using the objects you defined above, but instead querying the world directly

```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [example-solution]

base_C_body_query = the(entity(let(RevoluteConnection, world.connections)))

base_C_body = base_C_body_query.evaluate()
body = base_C_body.child

with world.modify_world():
    world.remove_connection(base_C_body)
    world.remove_kinematic_structure_entity(body)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [verify-solution, remove-input]
# After removal, the body must be gone and only one connection should remain
assert all(b is not body for b in world.bodies), "The child body `body` should be removed."
assert len(world.connections) == 1, "There should be exactly one connection left (root -> base)."
```

# Loading worlds from files

This tutorial shows how to load a world description from a file into a `World` object using the `MultiParser`.

First, we need to compose the path to your world file.

```python
import logging
import os



logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)
apartment = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "..", "resources", "urdf", "apartment.urdf")

```

Next we need to initialize a parser that reads this file. There are many parsers available. We will use the most capable one, the MultiParser.

```python
from semantic_world.adapters.multi_parser import MultiParser

parser = MultiParser(apartment)
world = parser.parse()
print(world)
```

This constructs a world you can visualize, interact and annotate. Be aware that worlds loaded from files have no semantic annotations and serve as purely kinematic models.
Supported file formates are:
- urdf
- mjcf
- stl
